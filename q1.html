      Hi Customer,

	Thank you for reaching out ‚Äî I completely understand how stressful it can be when your site feels unreachable. I checked Cloudflare‚Äôs global status and can confirm that our nameservers are fully	o	perational. From my side, your domain is resolving correctly across multiple networks.

	In cases like this, the root cause usually isn‚Äôt our nameservers but rather something in the DNS setup itself ‚Äî things like incorrect records, propagation delays, or registrar settings. To be absolutely 	sure, I ran queries using tools like dig and nslookup from different locations, and everything looks consistent. I also verified on our Cloudflare Status page
 	that no related incidents are ongoing.

	My suggestion would be to double-check your DNS records within the Cloudflare dashboard and ensure they match what your hosting provider expects. If you‚Äôd like, I can walk you through those steps.

	Best regards,
    </p>

    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>
      Since Cloudflare operates a globally distributed nameserver system with redundancy,
      a total outage is extremely unlikely. The issue is often caused by propagation delay,
      incorrect DNS records, or mismatched registrar settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools I Would Use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>dig/nslookup:</strong> To query DNS records from multiple locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare DNS Analytics:</strong> To verify requests are resolving.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Status Page:</strong> To confirm no incident is ongoing.</li>
    </ul>
