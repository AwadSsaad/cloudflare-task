    <h2>Response</h2>
    <p>
      Hi Customer,

	Thanks for flagging this. I know it can be frustrating when a Worker works perfectly in the debugger but doesn’t seem to apply live. I did a quick review of your settings and it looks like the Worker 	itself is fine, but it hasn’t been bound to a route yet.
	On Cloudflare, adding a Worker requires linking it to a specific route pattern (for example, example.com/*). Without that step, requests to your domain won’t actually trigger the Worker.
	To confirm, I checked your site with curl and saw no Worker headers in the response, which supports the route not being active. The good news is it’s a quick fix: just go to your Workers dashboard, select 	your Worker, and assign it a route.

	Once that’s done, it should start behaving as expected outside of the debugger. If it still doesn’t, I’d recommend purging cache and testing again.

	Let me know how it goes — happy to walk you through it step by step.

Cheers,
    </p>

    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>
      Workers don’t automatically apply to all requests unless assigned to a route.
      If no route is defined, production traffic will bypass the Worker completely.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools I Would Use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Dashboard (Workers → Triggers):</strong> To check routes.</li>
      <li><strong>curl with headers:</strong> To verify Worker response headers live.</li>
      <li><strong>Wrangler CLI:</strong> For debugging and testing deployments.</li>
    </ul>
