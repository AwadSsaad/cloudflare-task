      Hi Customer,

	That‚Äôs a great use case you‚Äôve brought up. You‚Äôre right ‚Äî Page Rules don‚Äôt allow redirection based on User-Agent strings. But you can absolutely achieve this using a Cloudflare Worker.
	With a Worker, you can inspect the incoming request headers and redirect based on conditions like browser type. For example, if the User-Agent contains MSIE 8.0, the Worker can issue a 302 redirect to a 	custom page you specify.
	I tested a simple Worker script in the Cloudflare dashboard to verify, and it worked as expected. It‚Äôs lightweight, runs at the edge, and doesn‚Äôt add noticeable latency.
	Would you like me to share a ready-to-use script that you can deploy right away?
	All the best,
    </p>

    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>
      Since Page Rules only allow redirection based on URL patterns, not headers, 
      the only Cloudflare-native solution is Workers. Workers give full control over requests, 
      including inspecting User-Agent and deciding how to respond.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools I Would Use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Workers:</strong> To implement the redirection logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Dashboard / Wrangler CLI:</strong> For deploying and testing the Worker.</li>
      <li><strong>Browser DevTools + curl:</strong> To test that the redirection works for different user agents.</li>
    </ul>
