	Hi Customer,

	Thanks for sharing the curl output ‚Äî that was very helpful. I noticed your server is returning the following header:

	<li>Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0</li>

	This essentially instructs Cloudflare (and browsers) not to cache your content. Since Cloudflare respects your origin server‚Äôs cache headers, the resources are being passed through rather than cached.
	To fix this, you have a couple of options:
	Adjust your origin server‚Äôs cache headers so they allow caching.
	Or, if you want Cloudflare to cache despite the headers, you can create a Page Rule or Cache Rule in the Cloudflare dashboard that overrides them.
	I tested this by re-requesting your site and confirmed that with the current headers, caching is bypassed. Once headers are updated (or a Page Rule is applied), caching should start working as expected.
	Happy to help configure the right rule if you‚Äôd like!
	Best regards,
    </p>

    <h3>Thought Process</h3>
    <p>
      Cloudflare respects origin headers by default. If an origin explicitly disables caching,
      the CDN won‚Äôt cache unless instructed to ignore or override via rules.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools I Would Use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>curl -I:</strong> To inspect HTTP response headers.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Dashboard (Caching):</strong> To apply cache level overrides.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Analytics:</strong> To confirm cache HIT/MISS ratios.</li>
    </ul>
